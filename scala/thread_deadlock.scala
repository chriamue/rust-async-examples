/*
 * DEADLOCK DEMONSTRATION IN SCALA
 * ==============================
 *
 * This example demonstrates a classic deadlock scenario where two threads
 * each hold a resource the other needs to proceed, creating a circular
 * dependency that causes both threads to wait indefinitely.
 *
 * KEY CONCEPTS:
 * - Deadlock: A situation where two or more threads are blocked forever,
 *   waiting for each other.
 * - Resource Contention: Multiple threads competing for exclusive access to resources.
 * - Circular Wait: Each thread holds a resource while waiting for another.
 *
 * SCENARIO:
 * - The Lion holds the Meat and wants the Cheese
 * - The Fox holds the Cheese and wants the Meat
 * - Neither can proceed, creating an unresolvable deadlock

     * 2. Lion tries to grab cheese (held by Fox)
     * 3. Fox tries to grab meat (held by Lion)
     * 4. Both wait indefinitely - deadlock!

    // DEADLOCK DETECTION:
    // Using a Promise and timeout to detect when deadlock occurs
    val promise = Promise[Unit]()

    /*
     * KEY LEARNING POINTS:
     *
     * 1. DEADLOCK CONDITIONS (all must be present):
     *    - Mutual Exclusion: Only one thread can use a resource at a time
     *    - Hold and Wait: Threads hold resources while waiting for others
     *    - No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from threads
     *    - Circular Wait: Circular chain of threads waiting for each other
     *
     * 2. PREVENTION STRATEGIES:
     *    - Resource Ordering: Always acquire locks in the same order
     *    - Timeout-based Locks: Use tryLock() with timeout instead of lock()
     *    - Deadlock Detection: Use monitoring and recovery mechanisms
     *    - Lock Hierarchy: Design a clear hierarchy for lock acquisition
     *
     * 3. SCALA-SPECIFIC NOTES:
     *    - Use higher-level concurrency primitives when possible
     *    - Consider java.util.concurrent tools for complex scenarios
     *    - Prefer immutable data and message-passing concurrency (Akka)
     *    - Use Scala's Future and Promise for async operations
