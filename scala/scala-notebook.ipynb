    "1.  **Synchronously (Blocking):** Using `Await.result`. This *blocks* the current thread until the Future completes. **Generally, avoid this in production asynchronous code** as it defeats the purpose of async and can lead to deadlocks (if we await on the main thread) or performance issues, especially on limited thread pools. It's primarily for testing or bridging async code back to blocking code (like in a `main` method or a legacy sync API).\n",
