/*
 * EAGER VS LAZY ASYNC EXECUTION IN SCALA
 * =====================================
 *
 * This example contrasts Scala's eager Future execution model with
 * a lazy execution approach more similar to Rust's async/await.
 *
 * KEY CONCEPTS:
 * - Eager Execution: Tasks start immediately when created
 * - Lazy Execution: Tasks start only when explicitly triggered
 * - Awaiting Results: Blocking until asynchronous work completes
 * - Function Composition: Using functions to delay execution
 *
 * COMPARISON WITH RUST:
 * - Scala Futures are eager (start immediately when created)
 * - Rust futures are lazy (only start when awaited)
 * - This fundamental difference affects how you structure async code

     * 2. Only call these functions when we want to start execution

  /*
   * KEY LEARNING POINTS:
   *
   * 1. EAGER VS LAZY EXECUTION:
   *    - Scala Futures: Eager (start executing immediately when created)
   *    - Rust Futures: Lazy (start executing only when awaited)
   *    - Simulated lazy execution in Scala requires wrapping in functions
   *
   * 2. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   *    - Eager: Ensures work begins ASAP, but can waste resources on unneeded tasks
   *    - Lazy: Gives more control over when work starts, but requires explicit triggering
   *    - Eager model makes error handling across futures more complex
   *
   * 3. DESIGN PATTERNS:
   *    - With eager futures, consider carefully when you create them
   *    - For maximum control, wrap Futures in functions (lazy approach)
   *    - Always be consistent about your approach to avoid confusion
   *
   * 4. WAITING FOR RESULTS:
   *    - Await.result in Scala is similar to .await in Rust
   *    - Both block execution of the current async context
   *    - Scala provides alternatives like callbacks and combinators (map/flatMap)
