/*
 * THREAD POOL SIZE EFFECTS IN SCALA
 * =================================
 *
 * This example demonstrates how the size of a thread pool affects the execution
 * of CPU-bound tasks in Scala's Future-based concurrency model.
 *
 * KEY CONCEPTS:
 * - Thread Pool: A collection of worker threads that execute tasks concurrently
 * - CPU-bound Tasks: Tasks that primarily use CPU resources (vs I/O-bound tasks)
 * - ExecutionContext: Scala's abstraction for running asynchronous computations
 * - Parallelism vs Concurrency: Thread pool size limits true parallelism
 *
 * EXPERIMENT:
 * Run this program with different thread pool sizes to observe the effect:
 * - With 1 thread: SCALA_WORKER_THREADS=1 scala async_threadpool.scala
 * - With 3 threads: SCALA_WORKER_THREADS=3 scala async_threadpool.scala

     * when the Future is created, not when it's awaited.

  /*
   * KEY LEARNING POINTS:
   *
   * 1. THREAD POOL SIZE MATTERS FOR CPU-BOUND WORK:
   *    - With 1 thread: ~3 seconds total (sequential execution)
   *    - With 3 threads: ~1 second total (parallel execution)
   *
   * 2. SCALA FUTURES ARE EAGER:
   *    - They begin execution as soon as they're created
   *    - This differs from lazy async models in some other languages
   *
   * 3. TASK CHARACTERIZATION IS IMPORTANT:
   *    - CPU-bound tasks benefit from more threads (up to CPU core count)
   *    - I/O-bound tasks can efficiently share fewer threads
   *    - Mixed workloads often need separate thread pools
   *
   * 4. SCALA SPECIFICS:
   *    - ExecutionContext is Scala's thread pool abstraction
   *    - The global ExecutionContext uses ForkJoinPool
   *    - Custom thread pools give more control over resource usage
   *    - Always shutdown() custom thread pools when done
